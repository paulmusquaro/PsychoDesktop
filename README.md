# PsychoDesktop

###### PyDelegator 2.0

#### Project Overview

**PsychoDesktop** is the next evolution of the **PyDelegator** project — a console-based bot designed to help you manage tasks like creating notes, managing contacts, and organizing files. In this version, the bot will not only perform these tasks but will also offer an expanded set of features, including integration with an SQLite database for efficient data storage and retrieval, instead of relying on file-based storage. This will make the bot faster, more flexible, and scalable.

## Plans for Future Development
- **PyPI Upload**: The project will be uploaded to PyPI, allowing easy installation and usage for anyone interested.
- **Cross-platform Support**: Enhancements for better compatibility across various platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **User Authentication**: Integration with user authentication to secure personal data.
- **Backup and Sync**: Implementation of a backup system and data synchronization across multiple devices.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Add NLP capabilities to understand and create notes in a more human-like way.
- **GUI Interface**: Develop a graphical user interface for non-technical users to interact with the bot.
- **SQLite Database instead of .txt files**: In this version of PyDelegator, the data storage system is transitioning from flat .txt files to a more efficient and scalable SQLite database. This shift will offer several key advantages: Structured Data, Performance, Data Integrity, Scalability.
- **Implement all Python standard library tools**: One of the main goals of this project is to comprehensively explore and utilize Python’s standard library, taking full advantage of the built-in tools to enhance the bot’s capabilities. 

## Goal
The primary goal of this project is to master the Python standard library while building a robust and scalable tool that helps users stay organized and productive. With the development of PyDelegator 2.0, I aim to enhance my understanding of Python’s core features and libraries, such as `sqlite3`, `argparse`, `os`, `shutil`, and others.

As for additional ideas, here are some possibilities:

- **Task Scheduling**: Add a scheduling feature that allows users to set reminders for notes or contacts.
- **Data Export/Import**: Enable exporting and importing notes/contacts from different formats (JSON, CSV, etc.).
- **Data Encryption**: Add encryption for storing sensitive data securely in the SQLite database.
- **Cloud Storage Integration**: Sync notes and contacts with cloud storage solutions (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.).
- **Voice Command Integration**: Integrate voice commands to allow hands-free interaction with the bot.
- **Password Storage**: Incorporating secure password storage into PyDelegator 2.0 would not only enhance the utility of the bot but also make it an essential tool for managing sensitive data. The main aim here would be to create a system where passwords are encrypted, securely stored, and easy to manage, all while adhering to best practices for cybersecurity.

These enhancements would increase the usability and flexibility of PyDelegator 2.0, while also giving you a deeper understanding of Python’s capabilities.
